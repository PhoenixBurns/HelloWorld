Hello Earthlings
=============
Pay no attention to the Groligan class warbirds orbiting your planet, they're doing....ummm....research on your atmosphere, yeah, that's it.  Anyway, we have come here in search of pennies.  We have learned that your culture, long ago, used these items as a means of exchange.  They are highly prized on our world for their iconic image of the great ancient donut maker Alagrabhan.  So, we will destroy all life on your planet in search of them, thank you, and goodbye.
